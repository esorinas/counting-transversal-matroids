# Counting Transversal Matroids
This project finds and counts transversal matroids and is part of my Master's thesis (link not available yet) **Extensions of transversal matroids** for the [Master in Advanced Mathematics and Mathematical Engineering](https://mamme.masters.upc.edu/en) at UPC (Barcelona).

The code is written entirely in [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/), although most of the tools are Python native. The strategy that we follow is described in the referenced project.
